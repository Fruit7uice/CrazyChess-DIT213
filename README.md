--------
**Info**

For this project we chose to implement an application which is our personal take on chess. Our application partly consists of the Classic chess-implementation, and it also consists of a "Crazy" chess-implementation(not fully implmented yet).

The classical version is a normal take on chess with classic rules and normal behaviors for the pieces.
The "Crazy" version of our Chess however, acts a bit differently than the classic one, it consists of an implementation with special rules and behaviors for the pieces.

**How to run**

Our program is internally built by initially running the main-menu view. This initializes in the game-class, here the game-class builds the application by running the main-method in the main-menu-view. Once here the user will be able to navigate to all the different parts of the application.

To run our application start by cloning the git-repo or download the zip-file. Once downloaded navigate to the top-level directory of the project which in our case would be equivalent to CrazyChess-DIT213. 
From here you should execute the following command in the terminal: " _**mvn clean javafx:run**_ "
as this will launch the main-menu of the game.
